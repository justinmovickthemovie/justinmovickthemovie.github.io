my name is justin D Movick being raised ny good parents my mom my stepdad and my dad and the lds church i found grace with God at an early age. 
i went to peter boscow elementary school for the first four years of my schooling. During my fourth year of school, my parents had us move from the suburbs of northwest Hillsboro, OR to a rural house on a hazlenut orchard. I have many fond memories on that nut orchard bicylcing, zip-lining, and exploring.
the first year I attended my new school, Farmington View Elementary I was 10 years. I liked that sxjool even better than my first one. 
i made friends: rafa, wil, Nick, Jeff, Brittany, Talea. i had secret crushes on kristen and nicole. life has been good to me so far.
get this when i entered 5th grade i thought to reinvent myself. I started swearing on the playground during recess. during that time I sold bags of sugar with kool-aid mixed in.
