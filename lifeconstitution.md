hereby i implement this life constitution for and on behalf of me, Justin David Movick, affirming and reaffirming  man's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. these articles are thus:

## life

	life is the gift of breathe we are all given found to be through our decisions to make one prosper. life therefore is prosperity and prosperity is success in breathe to overcome all obstacles.

## liberty

	liberty is my divine birthright to be however i am, to go whereever i will, and to love whatever that means. liberty is more than freedom because nothing is free therein and thereby liberty comes through affluence in speech for as Wittgenstien says the limits of your language is the limits of your world.

## Pursuit of Happiness

	The pursuit of happiness is acknowledgment that good things take their time and that the state of man is always changing wherein it is a checkpoint allowed by divine providence to provide contrast in and out of each state. It is obtained on occasion to provide check point towards the next one and so on and so forth.

### Eating habits


	eat well my mother says. she had us on a balanced diet of grains, meats, vegetables, and fruits. eat fast unless on holiday then the meal is to be eaten while commenting on how good it is. meat on holidays is an especial token of God's Grace.

### Bodily Cleanliness

	the body is to be kept as clean as possible. one must wash as often as possible. This includes taking good care of the both finger and toe nails.

### Compassionate Living Spaces

	we are products of our environments.

### Regarding Race

	No man knows himself until he knows another of another race.

### Style of Attire
	
	dress with loose fitting attire, knowing one must impress himself first and foremost and then in faith asserting all is vanity. choose plain colors and designs; this may be unless at a wedding when rules are meant to be bent.

### Religion

	religion and its mysteries are essential for the well being of man; take care to note it is a serious game for the welfare of society however in and of the nature of the creature there are non-serious games we play for each other to get what is needful. thank the heavenly father for what is present leaving room for the changes of life.
