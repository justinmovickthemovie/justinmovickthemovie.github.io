hereby i implement this life constitution for and on behalf of me, Justin David Movick, affirming man's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. these articles are thus:

## life
	life is the gift of breathe we are all given found to be in our decisions to make one prosper. life therefore is prosperity and prosperity is success in breathento overcome all obstacles.

## liberty
	liberty is my divine birthright to be however i am, to go whereever i will, and to love whatever that means. liberty is more than freedom because nothing is free therein and thereby liberty comes through affluence in speech for as they say the limits of your language is the limits of your world.

## Pursuit of Happiness
	The pursuit of happiness is acknowledgment that good things take their time and that the state of man is always changing wherein it is a checkpoint allowed by divine providence to provide contrast in and out of each state. It is obtained on occasion to provide check point towards the next one and so on and so forth.
